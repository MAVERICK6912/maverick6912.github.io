## Introduction

A majority of aspiring data scientists are either software engineers, freshers or people who do not have a background/degree in statistics. So, sometimes it becomes daunting to keep up with the statistics involved with various Machine Learning techniques.

> If you aim to be a good data scientist you need to be on top of your stats game.

With this blog I will try my best to answer these questions:
- **What is PDF?**
- **Why do we need PDF?**
- **What is CDF?**
- **Why do we need CDF?**

So, lets get to it!

## What is Probability Density Function(PDF)?

First let's take a look at what Wikipedia says:

>  The PDF is used to specify the probability of the random variable falling within a particular range of values, as opposed to taking on any one value.

Well, thats why I said statistics could be a little daunting.

Here's a **simpler definition** for a Probability Density Function:

> Probability Density Function(PDF) of a distribution gives the probability of a **range of values** belonging to a distribution of data.

In the above definition observe that I mention that PDF of a distribution for a **range of values** and not a single value. The simple reason for that is, finding exact probability of a single value belonging to a distribution will be zero.

> PDF of a distribution can very well be drawn without actual data if type of distribution, mean and variance are known.

Lets take an example to understand this better:

Suppose we plot PDF of a sample of 640 people applying for a loan.

```python
# importing required libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sbn
# Loading data to dataframe
data=pd.read_csv('load_pred.csv')
# plotting PDF of ApplicantIncome
sbn.distplot(data['ApplicantIncome'])
```
![PDF of Applicant Income]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/pdf_cdf/pdf_of_applicant_income.JPG)

From the above plotted PDF of _ApplicantIncome_ we can see that a majority of points in distribution lie between 0 to 20,000.

Now, our business users ask a question as to approximately how many applicants have an income of <10,000?

Since we already have a PDF plot all that we can do now is find the area under the curve <10,000. This can be done easily by finding the integral of the PDF.

Lets say PDF of our LoanApplicants distribution(X) is:
So, PDF of X can be written as:

$$P(X)$$

Hence, area under the curve for $$P(X)$$ will be:

$$\int_{0}^{10000} P(X) dx$$

Similarly we can find probability of an applicant's income being $$ X\in(10000,20000)$$ as:

$$\int_{10000}^{20000} P(X) dx$$

> Note: Since the ***probability of a range is given by the integral of PDF curve***, the area for probability of a single value will be zero. As the single value will be a line on the X-axis and area of a line=0(line has infinitesimally small width, hence area ).

## Why do we need PDF?

As seen above the PDF of a distribution can help us estimate the probability of values belonging to the distribution over a range.

Just by looking at a PDF plot, we can tell the following:

- If the data is normally distributed, about 68% of actual data lies in the range of ($$-1 \times standard deviation$$, $$ +1 \times standard deviation $$). About 95% of data lies in the range of ($$ -2 \times standard deviation $$, $$ +2 \times standard deviation $$). About 97% of data lies in the range of ($$ -3 \times standard deviation, $$ +3 \times standard deviation $$). This is also known as the **68–95–97 rule**.
- Spread of data or variance of distribution.
- Where do majority of the values lie.


## What is Cumulative Distribution Function(CDF)?

Lets take a look at Wikipedia's definition of CDF:

>In probability theory and statistics, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a real-valued random variable $$X$$ , or just distribution function of $$X$$ , evaluated at $$x$$, is the probability that $$X$$ will take a value less than or equal to $$x$$.

In simple words:

> CDF is the probability that a random variable $$X$$, will take a value less than or equal to $$x$$. ***CDF always lies between 0 and 1***.

Mathematically:

$$ F_X(x)= P(X \leq x )$$

### Properties of CDF:
- Every cumulative distribution function $$F(X)$$ is non-decreasing.
- Every cumulative distribution function $$F(X)$$ is right-continuous.
- $$\lim_{x\to\infty} F_X(x)=1$$
- $$\lim_{x\to-\infty} F_X(x)=0$$

Suppose for the example above we want to find out what is the probability that of all the applicants who apply for loan have an income less than 20000?

Lets plot the CDF for this to answer the question better:

```python
# plotting CDF of ApplicantIncome
sbn.distplot(data['ApplicantIncome'],kde_kws={'cumulative': True})
```

Note that to plot the CDF all we changed in the code was:
```python
# adding kde_kws(Kernel Density Estimation keyword args)
# by specifying cumulative=True we tell seaborn to plot CDF.
 kde_kws={'cumulative': True}
 ```

![CDF of Applicant Income]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/pdf_cdf/cdf_of_applicant_income.JPG)

From the above plot we can see that about 98% of applicants will probably have income $$\leq$$ 20000.

## Why do we need CDF?

By plotting CDF of a distribution we can very easily tell the probability of points lying in distribution $$\leq$$ to a given value.
