## Introduction
I am a .Net developer by profession based out of Bengaluru with two years of experience. Last year I made up my mind to dive deeper into the world of data science. After almost a year I can say that I have learned a lot and there's still a lot to learn. From exploring the data to modelling ANN(Artificial Neural Network) I have tried many things, sometimes my models performed worse than a base model and at other times I trained models that performed very well. That's how learning works, you make mistakes, learn from them and keep the process going.

## What is my aim for writing these blogs?

With this blog series **I aim to explain the Machine Learning concept in a simple and easy to understand tone and language**. In each of these blogs I will try my best to explain:
 - **Why we need a certain Machine Learning concept?**
 - **What concepts are useful for a Machine Learning Process?**
 - **Real life examples.**
 - **Code examples related to each concept**.
 
## My expectation from the reader

 I expect the reader to have some prior or at least minimal knowledge of:
 - **Statistical concepts like: _Mean, Median, Variance and Distributions_.**
 - **Basic knowledge of python and libraries like: _Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib_.**
 - **Basic theoretical knowledge of Machine Learning Models**.  

I will try to build up on these concepts and explain other related concepts.  

## What will I cover?

In this blog series I will cover major steps involved in a Machine Learning process. Under each step I will explain the concepts required for that step. There are a lot of concepts that are required in a machine learning process. So, this might be a big series of blogs.  

> Data science is a vast field, you can only conquer it one concept at a time.

## Closing words
This blog series can act as a good learning point for those who have just started with Data Science and a good reference point for those who have some experience with Data Science and are looking to revise a few concepts.

I will try my best to explain each concept in-depth and in an easy language.

> Hope you will enjoy the blog!
